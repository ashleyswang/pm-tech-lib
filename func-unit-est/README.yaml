# YAML Configuration Files

# General Structure:
#   * technology  : class containing info for func_units for a specific technology
#   * name        : technology name
#   * func_unit   : class containing metrics for a particular func_unit
  
#  Metrics: int_power, switch_power, dynamic_power, dynamic_energy, leak_power, area
#   * defined as either a float, relation to another tech, or calculation
#   * if the input is a float, we directly use the value for the metric
#   * ref : (func_unit object) refered technology
#   * rel : (float) use <rel*ref.metric> as estimated value
#   * calc: (str) explicit expression to calculate as estimated value
#   * conf: (float) confidence level, metric value = (estimated value)*(1 +/- conf)
